Entropy-Complexity for ordinal patterns.

**Code:**
ordec.py --- calculation of entropy and complexity on ordinal patterns (+multivariate time series)

ordec_borders.py --- calculation of theoretical boundaries

ORDEC_EXAMPLE.ipynb --- usage example

**Results:**
clf --- classifier by entropy-complexity
